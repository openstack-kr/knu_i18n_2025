"Like SR-IOV, vDPA leverages DMA transfer between the guest and hardware. "

"allocated by the guest and can be allocated anywhere in the guest RAM, QEMU "
"locks **all** guest RAM. By default the ``RLIMIT_MEMLOCK`` for a normal QEMU "
"intance is set to 0 and qemu is not allowed to lock guest memory. In the "
"case of SR-IOV, libvirt automatically set the limit to guest RAM + 1G which "
"enables QEMU to lock the memory. This does not happen today with vDPA ports. "
"As a result if you use VDPA ports without enabling locking of the guest "
"memory you will get DMA errors. To workaround this issues until libvirt is "
"updated, you must set ``hw:cpu_realtime=yes`` and define a valid ``CPU-"
"REALTIME-MASK`` e.g ``hw:cpu_realtime_mask=^0`` or define "
"``hw:emulator_threads_policy=share|isolate``. Note that since we are just "
"using ``hw:cpu_realtime`` for its side-effect of locking the guest memory, "
"this usage does not require the guest or host to use realtime kernels. "
"However, all other requirements of ``hw:cpu_realtime`` such as requiring "
"hw:cpu_policy=dedicated still apply. It is also stongly recommended that "
"hugpages be enabled for all instnace with locked memory. This can be done by "
